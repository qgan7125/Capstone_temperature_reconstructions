# Capstone Temperature Reconstructions

## Goals
We expect to improve the basic toolbox for inferring temperature reconstructions based on the ‘clumped isotopes’ paleothermometer. Using three synthetic datasets with varying errors for temperature (independent variable) and Δ47 (response variable), we will examine the performance of alternative regression models on recovering true simulation parameters with the highest precision and smallest associated uncertainty. We will particularly focus on parametric models that are able to describe linear associations between variables under an univariate framework. Previous research in the field has examined the performance of a limited set of regression models (commonly used in the field; OLS, Deming, York regressions) in the context of parameter estimates. However, these studies have failed to examine the performance of other regression approaches. For instance, weighted and unweighted orthogonal distance regression models are still to be examined in a comparative framework. In this capstone project, we will explore additional models that could improve accuracy and precision during parameter estimation based on ‘clumped isotope’ data.
